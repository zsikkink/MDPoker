    Environment to simulate a heads-up pre-flop Texas Hold'em hand.
    
    At the start of the hand, both players start with stacks of 100.
    The BTN posts a blind of 0.5 and the BB posts a blind of 1.
    Contributions are initialized as {BTN: 0.5, BB: 1}.
    A new deck is created, shuffled, and cards are dealt.
    
    On each turn, the active player's state is generated using get_state 
    followed by get_state_vector_for_deep_rl. The player then selects an action.
    
    - If BTN folds, calculate_reward_fold is called, rewards are assigned, 
      and the hand is reset.
    - If BTN calls, the contributions are updated to {BTN: 1, BB: 1}, 
      the betting history and BTN's stack are updated, and then BB_actions are used.
    - If BB checks, the hand ends immediately (calculate_reward_no_fold is called), 
      and the hand resets.
    - If any player raises, contributions, betting history, stack, and the pot are updated,
      the turn passes to the opponent and available actions are recalculated.
